# A very simple music player (with some songs in the library) i did when i finished learning basic vanilla JS

_Have to admit that this code has lots and lots of repetitions and some minor bugs too_

**Until and unless i get some time to fix these issues i couldn't look into these bugs and also refactor the code .. But i will find some time to fix them for sure**

## Feel free to tweak this
